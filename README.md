## Instructions

All dart scripts are located inside the lib folder.

- Widgets are inside Recipes-App/lib/widgets/
- Simple object models are in Recipes-App/lib/models/
- Dummy data used is in a separate .dart file in the root directory ./dummy_data.dart

To run this app on a virtual machine (mobile emulator), your android device or your web browser, just clone the project, open your terminal inside that folder and use this command: 
```
flutter run
```
(Must have flutter in the system PATH, and USB Debugging enabled if you're using an Andriod device)
